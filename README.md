The S&P 500 is a stock market index that measures the performance of 500 large publicly traded companies in the United States. It is widely regarded as one of the best indicators of the U.S. stock market's health and is commonly used by investors as a benchmark for their portfolio performance. It covers about 80% of the total market value of U.S. companies.

Bitcoin (BTC) is the world's first and most valuable cryptocurrency. Unlike the S&P 500, which tracks companies, Bitcoin is a digital asset designed to work as a decentralized payment system, independent of banks or governments. Its price is known for high volatility, meaning its value can fluctuate significantly.

The S&P 500 & Bitcoin dataset is available here, which I have analysed. 

The tasks I have worked in this project:

1- Descriptive Statistics: I have calculated the mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation, etc, of both the S&P 500 data and Bitcoin data.  Compared the measures of central tendency and variability between the two datasets.

2- By drawing a plot, showing the trend or pattern of S&P 500 data and Bitcoin data over seven years for each dataset separately, and interpreting the findings. Additionally, i have created a plot that shows the correlation calculated every six months between the S&P 500 data and Bitcoin data over seven years.

3- Computed the correlation coefficient between S&P 500 data and Bitcoin data to explore if there's any relationship between the two. Visualized the relation/correlation using scatter plots and interpreted the findings. 

4- Assessed whether the S&P 500 data and Bitcoin data follow a normal distribution. Analyzed each dataset separately and interpreted the findings.
